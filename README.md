# CTEC
Crafting table exploit mod for fabric
This mod spams crafting packets. It is basically an automated method to do [this exploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQrTjgVf7no)
## Download
Go to get [jarfile](https://github.com/AriliusClient/CTEC/blob/master/build/libs/CTEC-1.0.jar?raw=true), put into mods folder of [fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) 1.16.4, download [fabric api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), drag fabric api to mods folder, launch game, poggers

You may need to install the [branding mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/branding) if the server blocks fabric. 
## Usage
You may use any type of craftable item, wood planks are the easiest to obtain. 
1. get 6 stacks of planks of any wood type
2. type the following command: `@ctec setrecipes <woodtype>_stairs <woodtype>_slab`
3. type the following command: `@ctec toggle`
4. access a crafting table
5. wait for the "Server is lagging" messages in chat

### Note 
if it shows any kind of error when you execute `setrecipes`, the server either

1. patched it
2. patched a dupe glitch and accidentally patched this
3. doesn't think you unlocked the recipies of those things yet

in case of the last one, craft the items that you will be using to lag the server once and run the command again

have fun and dont crash my server plz
